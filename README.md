# Box-office-data-analysis
Analysing box office data using seaborn and plotly
In this project, I worked with The Movie Database(TMDB) Box Office Prediction data set. 
I used statistical data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Plotly to generate interactive, publication-quality graphs.

The tasks which I performed in this project:-
-Visualized the target distribution using the Seaborn's distplot function.
-Determined how official homepages impact the revenue of the film.
-Checked the distribution of languages across films to determine which language generates the highest revenue.
-Created a Word Cloud to represent the common words in film titles and descriptions.
-Used Plotly's scatter function to Visualize the Number of Films Per Year.
-Determined how the release days impacted the revenue of the film.
-Created two different plots to figure out how the runtime affects the revenue of the film.
